# Maximum Value

Find the Maximum Value in a Binary Tree

## Challenge Requirements

Write a function called find-maximum-value which takes binary tree as its only input. 
Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the 
maximum value stored in the tree. You can assume that the values stored in the Binary 
Tree will be numeric.

                 3          =>          15
                /\                       
               5  8                   
              /\                     
             4  15                   

## Approach & Efficiency

[Test Code](../../../test/java/MaximumValue)

    Big O:
      Space -> O(1) -  temp variable update method
      Time -> O(N) - Have to go through entire tree
