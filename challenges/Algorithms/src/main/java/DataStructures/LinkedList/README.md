# LinkedList

A List of Nodes, each with a reference to the next Node in the list.

## Challenge

Implement a Singly Linked List Data Structure

## Approach & Efficiency

    Collection of Nodes to store data, similary to arrays.

    Big O:
      Space -> O(N)
      Time -> O(N)

## API

    print() - Prints the value of all of the Nodes within a created Linked List.
    
    insert(Node node) - Adds an input node to the front of the Linked List (the head)
    
    append(Node node) - Adds an input node to the end of the Linked List

    includes() - check to see if a value exists in the Linked List
