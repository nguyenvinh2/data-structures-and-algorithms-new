# Breadth First Traversal

Breadth-first Traversal.

## Challenge Requirements

Write a breadth first traversal method which takes a Binary Tree as its unique input. 
Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, traverse the 
input tree using a Breadth-first approach; print every visited nodeâ€™s value.


Visual

                 3          =>          3, 5, 8, 4, 15
                /\                       
               5  8                   
              /\                     
             4  15                   

## Approach & Efficiency

[Code](../../../main/java/DataStructures/Tree/BinaryTree.java)

[Test Code](../../../test/java/DataStructures/Tree/BinaryTreeTest.java)

    Big O:
      Space -> O(N) -  Using a Queue
      Time -> O(N) - Have to go through entire tree
