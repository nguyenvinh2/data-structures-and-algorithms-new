# Array Reverse

    Add an element to an array at a selected index.

## Challenge

    Write a function called insertShiftArray which takes in an array and the value to be added. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with the new value added at the middle index.

    Example:

    [2,4,6,8], 5 ->	[2,4,5,6,8]
    [4,8,15,23,42], 16 ->	[4,8,15,16,23,42]

## Approach & Efficiency

    Solved using for loop. Need to create new Array and copy values from input array.

    Big O:
      Space -> O(N)
      Time -> O(N)
