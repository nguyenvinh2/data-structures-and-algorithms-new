### Assignment Requirements


    Write a function that accepts a lengthy string parameter.
    Without utilizing any of the built-in library methods available to your language, return the first word to occur more than once in that provided string.

## Approach & Efficiency
    
    Split string into array, iterates through and stores in hashtable after determine if key already exists.
    if key exists, confirmation there is repeated word.

    Big O:
      Space -> O(N) - uses array based on string length
      
      
      Time: 
      O(N) loop time dependent on size of string
