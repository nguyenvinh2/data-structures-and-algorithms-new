# Depth First Graph

## Challenge Description

Conduct a depth first preorder traversal on a graph

## Challenge

### Assignment Requirements

Create a function that accepts an adjacency list as a graph, and conducts a depth 
first traversal. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your 
language, return a collection of nodes in their pre-order depth-first traversal 
order.



## Approach & Efficiency
    
    Recursive Solution

    Big O:
      Space -> O(N) - List to store nodes
      
      Time: 
      O(N) - Time is spent collecting unique nodes
